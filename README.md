# olcPixelGameEngine - DirectX 11 fork --- it is not directly forked since I wanted more github features (https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/ <-- the original project)
a **NOT** official distribution of olcPixelGameEngine - I am just a person who made an extension because I saw use and value in it. The DirectX 11 renderer has the main benifit of superior performance than the other avaible OpenGL 3.3 renderer (for AMD graphics cards specifically), as well as allowing me to have the ability to make a DirectX 11 extension for macro creation that utilizes shaders) - the DirectX 11 renderer is created by Ariel Glasroth, AKA 16-Bit-Dog

**You only need the one file - olcPixelGameEngine.h - included in your project!**

[most of the description is kept from the original repos...-16_bit dog]

Provides a fast, richly featured, cross platform pixel drawing and user interface framework for
 * The development of games
 * Visualisation of algorithms
 * Prototyping and experimentation
 * Education

This fork supports original PGE extensions for:
 * 2D Affine transforms
 * 3D Software renderer
 * Controller input
 * Sound
 * Hardware interfaces
 
DX11olcPixelGameEngine is easy to port! Runs on:
 * Windows (all) 
 * Linux with wine...
 
This fork of olcPixelGameEngine is maintained and developed on - currently for a 3d extension!
